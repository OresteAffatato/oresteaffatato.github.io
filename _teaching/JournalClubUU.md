I was responsible for journal club discussions and seminars given by students in psychiatry and neurology, between the academic years 2021 and 2023. The aim was to help the students to get a deeper understanding of the published research, how to analyze and interpret a scientific article, as well as discussing methodologies and results in the pathophysiology of addiction, sleep disorders, and treatment-resistant depression. This was part of the course <em>Klinisk Medicin IV</em> (eng: <em>Clinical Medicine IV</em>).
